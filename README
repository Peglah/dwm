dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.


Update custom branch
------------
Hereâ€™s a summarized workflow:
Update master branch with upstream changes:

    git checkout master
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/master
    git push origin master

Reapply patches on custom branch:

    git checkout custom
    git rebase master

If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will prompt you to resolve them. Fix the conflicts in the affected files, then continue the rebase:

    git add <resolved-file>
    git rebase --continue

If you want to abort the rebase:

    git rebase --abort

Push your changes:

    git push origin custom
